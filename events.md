## Annual Bennington Bash

We enjoyed a beautiful Sunday Evening Neighborhood Night on September 25th! 

Thank you to everyone who was able to participate in the event. 

Fun activities, great food & drinks were enjoyed by all. Thank you to the Bennington Park Social Commitee for organizing another successful neighborhood bash in 2022!

## Annual Bennington Bash

We enjoyed a beautiful Sunday Evening Neighborhood Night on September 26th! 

Thank you to everyone who was able to stop by and participate in the event. 

The Dunlap Fire Truck and three Dunlap Firefighters showed families their truck, tools and spoke about the different types of emergencies that they are prepared to help with in our community. Just as they were about to show the children their protective clothing, firefighters received a call and within a minute they were speeding off to help with a local emergency. We thank all firefighters for their important role in our community and we feel lucky to have them so close to our neighborhood.

Children and adults enjoyed cool ice cream treats while they met new neighbors and enjoyed sticker sheets (Thank you, Mary Clare Geraghty). Carolina Gabbai shared information about recycling that she is promoting and accepting, please see the photos for more information. She is happy to take any items for these recycling streams with a quick porch drop off or message for pickup. The Goodell Family had their Indian Corn on display and for sale and many neighbors chalked their sidewalk for the festivities. If you were not able to attend, we hope you are doing well and can participate in our neighborhood Trick or Treating similar to last year. Keep your eye out for information coming soon.
